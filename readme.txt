 address and any other sensitive content caught robots.

== Description ==

Enigma encrypts text on demand and decrypts it on client to avoid your email
 address and any other sensitive content caught robots.

Use short code [enigma]...[/enigma] to encrypt any content of your post.

Samples:

1. [enigma]content I don't want search engine to catch.[/enigma]

    The content inside engima tag will be encrypted and search engines
    get nothing.

2. [enigma text="Hello World"]Actual Text[/enigma]

    Search engine will only see "Hello World" but normal user will see
    "Actual Text".

3. [enigma text="Click here" ondemand="y"]<img ...>[/enigma]

    A clickable instruction "Click here" is shown, and after user clicks it,
    the text will be replaced with the <img>.

4. [engima text="Reply and see" ondemand="replied"]Content that is not visiable until reader replies.[/engima]
    The content will be invisible to user, until he/she replies. This feature
    is compatible with Wordpress caching plugins.
